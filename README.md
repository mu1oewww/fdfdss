# Objects in JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language, and objects are a core feature that make it both flexible and robust. This section will cover the fundamentals of objects in JavaScript, including their creation, properties, methods, and advanced usage.

### Introduction
## ***In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties. Each property is a key-value pair where the key is a string (or Symbol) and the value can be any data type, including other objects. Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.***

## Creating Objects
Using Object Literals
The most common way to create an object is by using an object literal. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

![alt text](image.png)
javascript
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  }
};
In the above example:

name and age are properties of the person object.
greet is a method (a function that is a property of the object) that logs a greeting to the console.
Using the new Object() Syntax
You can also create an object using the new Object() syntax:

javascript
```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.name = 'John Doe';
person.age = 30;
person.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
};
While this method works, using object literals is more concise and preferred in most cases.

Using a Constructor Function
Constructor functions are another way to create objects. They are useful when you want to create multiple objects with similar properties and methods.
 ```
# ***javascript***
```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.greet = function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  };
}

const person1 = new Person('John Doe', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Jane Doe', 25);
Accessing and Modifying Properties
Dot Notation
You can access and modify properties using dot notation:
 ```

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // John Doe
person.age = 31;
Bracket Notation
Bracket notation is useful when property names are dynamic or not valid identifiers:

javascript
```javascript
console.log(person['name']); // John Doe
person['age'] = 31;
You can also use bracket notation with variables:

javascript
```javascript
const property = 'name';
console.log(person[property]); // John Doe
Methods
Methods are functions defined inside an object. They can access and modify the object's properties using the this keyword.
```

```javascript
const calculator = {
  value: 0,
  add: function(num) {
    this.value += num;
  },
  subtract: function(num) {
    this.value -= num;
  }
};

calculator.add(5);
console.log(calculator.value); // 5
calculator.subtract(2);
console.log(calculator.value); // 3
```
 ## *** PrototypesEvery JavaScript object has a prototype. A prototype is also an object that can be used to build up properties and methods that are shared across instances.Prototype ChainWhen you access a property of an object, JavaScript first looks at the object itself. If it doesn't find the property, it looks up the prototype chain. ***
```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
};

const dog = new Animal('Dog');
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a noise.
In this example, speak is a method shared by all instances of Animal through its prototype.

Inheritance
JavaScript supports prototype-based inheritance. You can create a new object that inherits from another object.
```

```javascript
function Bird(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor
}

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Set up inheritance
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird; // Set the constructor property

Bird.prototype.fly = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' is flying.');
};
```

const parrot = new Bird('Parrot');
parrot.speak(); // Parrot makes a noise.
parrot.fly(); // Parrot is flying.
Summary
JavaScript objects are a fundamental part of the language, providing a way to store and manipulate data. They are versatile and can be created using literals, constructors, or prototype inheritance. Understanding how to use and manipulate objects effectively will greatly enhance your ability to work with JavaScript.
